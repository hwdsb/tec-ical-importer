The Events Calendar - iCalendar Importer
=======================================

This plugin allows site administrators to enter remotely-located iCalendar files to be synched and imported into [The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org).


How to use?
- 
* Make sure The Events Calendar is already installed and activated.
* Download, install and activate this plugin.
* Login to the WP admin dashboard and navigate to the "Events > iCal Import" page.
* Next, enter in the location of your iCalendar files.
* Optionally, add a category slug so your imported events can be categorized appropriately and also set a custom interval to let WordPress know when it should sync the iCalendar.
* Lastly, you can immediately test the import by checking the "Manual Sync" checkbox.
* Hit "Save changes" and that should be it!
